|===
| Member function | Effect
|`operator*()`
| Equivalent to the `'#'` format flag in `printf`

|`operator+()`
| Equivalent to the `'+'` format flag in `printf`

| `fill_sign()`
| Similar to the `' '` format flag in `printf`:
  prints an extra fill character ( from the alignment formatting )
  before non-negative numbers.

| `operator~()`
| Equivalent to `fill_sign()`

| `punct()`
| Applies the numeric punctuation according to the `numpunct_c` facet

| `operator!()`
| Equivalent to `punct()`

|`pad0(unsigned w)`
| Similar to the `'0'` format flag in `printf`:

For NaN and infinity, causes the the width ( from alignment
formatting ) to be at least equal to `w`.

For valid numbers, prints zeros after the sign and the base
indication and before the digits such that at least `w` characters
are printed ( not counting the fill characters caused by alignment formatting,
but still counting the extra fill character caused by `fill_sign()` ).

|`p(unsigned precision)`
| Sets the precision. Effect varies according to the notation ( see below ).

|`set_float_notation(float_notation)`
a|
`float_notation::hex`::
 Hexadecimal
`float_notation::fixed`::
If precision is not set, prints the smallest number of digits
such that the floating-point value can be exactly recovered.
If precision is set, it is the number of fractional digits.
`float_notation::scientific`::
  If precision is not set, prints the smallest number of digits
  such that the floating-point value can be exactly recovered.
  If precision is set, it is the number of fractional digits.
`float_notation::general`::
If precision is not set, chooses the notation ( scientific or fixed ) that leads
to the smallest number or characters such that the floating-point value
can be exactly recovered.
+
If precision is set, same effect as the `'g'` format flags in `printf`
( except that the lettercase is specified by the
<<lettercase,lettercase>> facet ):
+
- The precision is the number of significant digts
- If precision is 0, it is treated as 1
- Trailing fractional zeros are removed unless `operator*` is used.
- Selects the scientific notation iff the resulting exponent
  is less than -4 or greater than or equal to the precision

|`hex()`
| Equivalent to `set_float_notation(float_notation::hex)`.

|`fixed()`
| Equivalent to `set_float_notation(float_notation::fixed)`.

|`sci()`
| Equivalent to `set_float_notation(float_notation::scientific)`.

|`gen()`
| Equivalent to `set_float_notation(float_notation::general)`.
