| Member function | Effect
|`operator*()`
| Equivalent to the `'#'` format flag in `printf`

|`operator+()`
| Equivalent to the `'+'` format flag in `printf`

|`pad0(unsigned w)`
| Similar to the `'0'` format flag in `printf`:

  For NaN and infinity, causes the the width ( in alignment
  formatting ) to be at least equal to `w`.

  For valid number, prints zeros after the sign and the base
  indication and before the digits such the total number
  of characters ( not couting the fill related to alignment formatting )
  is at least equal to `w`.

|`p(unsigned precision)`
| Sets the precision.

|`hex()`
| Hexadecimal notation.

|`fixed()`
| Fixed notation. If precision is set, it is the number of fractional
  digits.

  If precision is not set,
  prints the smallest number of digits such that the floating-point value
  can be exactly recovered.

|`sci()`
| Scientific notation. If precision is set, it is the number of fractional
  digits.

  If precision is not set,
  prints the smallest number of digits such that the floating-point value
  can be exactly recovered.

|`gen()`
| If precision is not set, chooses the notation ( scientific or fixed ) that leads
  to the smallest number or characters such that the floating-point value
  can be exactly recovered.

  If precision is set, same effect the `'g'` format flags in `printf`
  ( except that the lettercase is specified by the
   <<lettercase,lettercase>> facet. )
