| Member function | Effect
|`bin()`
|  Uses the binary base.

|`oct()`
|  Uses the octal base.

|`dec()`
| Uses the decimal base.

|`hex()`
| Uses the hexadecimal base.

|`operator*()`
| Equivalent to the `'#'` format flag in `printf`. Only applicable in non-decimal bases.

|`operator+()`
| Equivalent to the `'+'` format flag in `printf`. Only applicable in decimal base.

| `operator~()`
| Equivalent to `fill_sign()`

| `fill_sign()`
| Similar to the `' '` format flag in `printf`:
  prints an extra fill character ( specified by some of the alignment format function )
  before non-negative numbers. Only applicable in decimal base.

| `punct()`
| Applies the numeric punctuation according to the `numpunct_c` facet

| `operator!()`
| Equivalent to `punct()`

| `pad0(unsigned w)`
| Inserts zeros after the sign or base indication and before the digits
  such that at least `w` characters are printed
  ( not counting the fill characters caused by alignment formatting,
   but still counting the extra fill character caused by `fill_sign()` ).

|`p(unsigned precision)`
| Inserts zeros after the sign or base indication and before the digits
  such that at least `precision` digits are printed
